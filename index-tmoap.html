og-title: "Too Much of a Person | Taking up all the space"
og-url: http://toomuchofaperson.com
og-description: "Too Much of a Person is a project chronicling the experiences of self-identifying women and non-binary people being told they were 'too much' of something (nice, loud, sensitive, aggressive etc.) to dismiss or conform them to the current perception of how a woman should be. Your too much could be your power. Letâ€™s reclaim that, take up space together and be whatever we want."
